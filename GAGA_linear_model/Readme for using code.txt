GaGa.R is the function for the GAGA algorithm.
Experiment_lambda.R works for the simulation in Section 1.3.
Experiment_A3.R works for the simulation on the Assumption (A3).
Experiment.R works for model 1.
Experiment2.R works for model 2.
Experiment3.R works for model 3.
ProstateCancer.R works for the prostate cancer dataset.
Experiment_timeCost.R for the time cost simulation.

We use the Package ncvreg (Breheny and Huang (2011)) in R for the adaptive LASSO, the SCAD, and
the MCP. All the experiments in R adopt the OpenBlas for performing basic vector and matrix operations.
